            Ethan Marcotte is an independent web designer based in Boston,
            Massachusetts. A few years ago, he coined the term “responsive web
            design” to describe a new way of designing for the ever-changing
            web. His popular books on the topic, Responsive Web Design and
            Responsive Design: Patterns and Principles, have been widely
            praised, showing how designers and organizations can leverage the
            web’s flexibility to design across mobile, tablet, and desktop—and
            whatever might come next. Over the years, Ethan has been a featured
            speaker at many conferences, including An Event Apart, Webstock, and
            SXSW Interactive. His clientele has included New York Magazine, the
            Sundance Film Festival, The Boston Globe, and People Magazine. He
            also cofounded Editorially, a collaborative writing platform.
